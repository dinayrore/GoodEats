# Application Behavior

The documents within this directory further explain the features and intended behavior of Good Eats! 

Think of each markdown file as it's own feature ticket - outlining acceptance criteria, calling out project dependencies and risks, as well as highlighting feature status. Refer to the [Application Behavior Template](./template.md) as an example.
