# Authentication

As a user I want to be able to login into my app in order to secure my application use.

AC: 
- Use Firebase Auth
- use contexts and hooks to manage user login status within the app 

- create login.screen.tsx 
- create login.styles.ts 
  - use application themes 
- create registration.screen.tsx 
- create registration.styles.ts 
  - use application themes
