# ADR 002: Using TypeScript

12 April 2023

## Context

TypeScript extends JavaScript and improves the developer experience by adding type safety to our code. With type safety we can avoid JS coercion, thus avoiding situations like [The Square Hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7haqnQvrYfI).

## Decision

We will be use TypeScript as the majority development programming language for our React Native Expo (bare workflow) app. 

## Status

Accepted.

## Consequences

TypeScript will provide type safety and prevent JavaScript coercion. 

TypeScript errors can be a bit cryptic. It is not a difficult language to learn, however it takes time and practice to understand what an error message intends to be fixed.
